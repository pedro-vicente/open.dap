# More fixes after resolving conflicts. This code still fails some tests.
#
# Revision 1.14.4.1  2003/10/03 16:26:30  jimg
# Fixed tests; I changed the text of das-test just a little and so these
# had to be updated. I wanted to be sure that the error message was from
# an exception and not just a write to stderr.

# Revision 1.14  2003/01/10 07:15:53  jimg
# resolved conflicts from the merge with release-3-2-10.

# Added tests for `#' in IDs.
#
# Revision 1.12.4.2  2002/06/11 00:31:20  jimg
# Fixed this test. It's better to test just for the Error word at the start of
# the das-test program's output. That way the same test can keep on working as
# long as the error message continues to start with that word. I also moved the
# log file to end of the file.
#
# Revision 1.12  2000/09/22 02:52:59  jimg
# Fixes to the tests to recognize some of the new error messages. Also,
# the test drivers were modified to catch the exceptions now thrown by
# some of the parsers.
